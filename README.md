## Description 
**Brain Games** is a set of five console games built on the principle of popular mobile applications for brain training. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, the game is considered completed. Incorrect answers end the game and offer to go through it again.

## Games
- Brain Even - answer if a number is even or not. 
- Brain Calc - make some calculations.
- Brain GCD - find the GCD(Great Commoner Division) for the two numbers.
- Brain Progression - find a missing number in arithmetic progression.
- Brain Prime - answer if a number is prime or not.
